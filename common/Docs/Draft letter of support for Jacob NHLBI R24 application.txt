Dear Dr. Jacob:

This letter is in support of your R24 application that proposes to develop 250 knockout (KO) and knockin (KIN) rat models for the NHLBI research community. The research in our laboratory focuses on _______________________.  Specifically, we use rat models to ___________________.   A rat knockout model for ____________ (gene) would be of great interest to us.  The cost to develop rat knockout models is prohibitive, but being able to obtain rats without the development cost would be of enormous benefit. 

Your approach seems to be very robust and efficient, providing animal models for validation studies for genes identified in genome wide association studies.  In addition to this valuable resource, your reputation for building rat resources and making them available to the scientific community is well recognized within the rat community. 

I wish you success with the application and look forward using these resources in my own research program.


Sincerely,


Your name here
