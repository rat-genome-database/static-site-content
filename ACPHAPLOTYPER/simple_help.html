<h1>ACP Haplotyper Help</h1>
<hr>
<h2><a name="map_to_be_used" id="map_to_be_used"></a>Map to be used</h2>
<p>Chose one of the available genetic or radiation hybrid maps. This map is then 
  used to provide the map order of the microsatellite markers used to create the 
  ACP haplotype image.</p>
<h2><a name="chromosome" id="chromosome"></a>Chromosome</h2>
<p>Select the chromosome that you would like to view the ACP haplotype for.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="strains_to_display" id="strains_to_display"></a>Strains to Display</h2>
<p>Select one or more individual rat strains to be included in the analysis. Chose 
  'All 48 Strains' to include all possible strains.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="primary_strain_and_color_scheme" id="primary_strain_and_color_scheme"></a>Primary 
  Strain and Color Scheme</h2>
<p>Select one primary strain against which all other selected strains are compared. 
  This choice affects the output in different ways depending on the <a href="#color_schemes">color 
  scheme</a> selected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="secondary_strain_and_color_scheme"></a>Secondary Strain and Color 
  Scheme</h2>
<p>This is an optional selection - select one secondary strain against which all 
  other selected strains are compared to . This choice affects the output in different 
  ways depending on the <a href="#color_schemes">color scheme</a> selected:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="color_schemes"></a>Color Schemes</h2>
<p>The color schemes affect how the visual haplotypes are colored and are best 
  suited to different types of analysis:</p>
<table width="90%" border="1" align="center">
  <tr valign="top" bgcolor="#CCCCCC"> 
    <td width="19%"><strong>Color Scheme</strong></td>
    <td width="21%"><strong>Best Used for</strong></td>
    <td width="60%"><strong>Description</strong></td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top"> 
    <td>Normal</td>
    <td>Comparing two strains against each other</td>
    <td>For each marker, if the allele size in Strain A matches that of the primary 
      strain, the marker block is colored according to the primary strain color. 
      If the Strain A size is different from the primary strain but the same size 
      as that found in the secondary strain (if selected) then the block has the 
      secondary color. If the size matches neither primary or secondary strains 
      it is colored black. If there is no allele size data for a marker in a particular 
      strain this is indicated by a 'X'.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top"> 
    <td>Multicolor Scheme</td>
    <td>Comparing many strains to see discontinuous haplotypes spread across the 
      chromosome. </td>
    <td>Blocks for each marker are colored according to the size difference between 
      the allele size in the particular strain and the size of the Primary Strain. 
      Blocks are colored according to a discontinuous color scheme depending on 
      the base pair size of the marker allele in a given strain as compared to 
      that marker's allele size in the primary strain.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top"> 
    <td>Red, White and Blue</td>
    <td>Comparing many strains to see overall patterns of conservation</td>
    <td>Blocks for each marker are colored according to the size difference between 
      the allele size in the particular strain and the size of the Primary Strain. 
      Blocks are colored white if they are the same size as the primary strain 
      and get increasingly red or blue as the base pair size is smaller or larger, 
      respectively, than that of the primary strain</td>
