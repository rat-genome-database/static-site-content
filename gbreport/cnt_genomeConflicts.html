<p align="left">The chromosome location of genes were compared between the   Baylor 3.4 and Celera genome assemblies. 164 genes were assigned to different   chromosomes in the two assemblies. 111 of these fell into 6 groups based on   sequential location of 5 or more genes. View   regions of the Baylor 3.4 genome assembly that differ from other   data.</p>

<h3><a href="/GenomeErrorReport/errEntry.jsp">Submit Genome Conflicts  </a></h3>
<p>RGD has  created a <a href="/GenomeErrorReport/errEntry.jsp">Genome Conflict   Submission Form</a> that will allow users to report any conflicts they find   in the genome sequence or annotations. The form is accessible from the   navigation bar at the top of every page as well as on the Genome Browser. On   this simple form you can indicate what regions are in question; we will then   contact you for the details. These regions will be reported to Baylor to use as   they continue to improve the assembly.<br />
