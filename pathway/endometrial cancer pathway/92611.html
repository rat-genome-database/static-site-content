A mutation in p53, but not overexpression of p53, is associated with a short-term survival benefit. A HLA-A2 restricted human CTL line recognizes a novel tumor cell expressed p53 epitope. A case-control study showed that polymorphism in codon 72 of the p53 gene was not a cervico-uterine cancer risk factor in Mexico. A cytoplasmic accumulation of wild-type p53 in human primary glioblastomas correlates with GFAP and vimentin expression. Cytoplasmic p53 is inactive in growth suppression. A link between the p53 germ line polymorphisms and white blood cells apoptosis in lung cancer patients. A loss of wild-type p53 gene function and consequent p53 overexpression in gastric carcinomas may be involved in early stages of tumor progression. A lower invasiveness and shorter survival was seen in tumors with a TP53 mutation. A new germline p53 mutation was found associated with a choroid plexus papilloma. The 7-BP insertion in exon 5 causes a frameshift from 161-182 and affected transactivation but not apoptosis induction. A novel germline mutation in p53 gene was found in a patient with Li-Fraumeni syndrome. A point mutation of p53 in a lung cancer patient simultaneously can elicit not only a humoral immune response against overexpressed p53 protein, but also a specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte response against the mutated epitope of p53 in the same patient. A potential association of P53 codon polymorphism was found with increased susceptibility to gastric cancer. A proteasome inhibitor, lactacystin, enhances TNFalpha cytotoxicity in p53-positive and -negative cells. A selective growth advantage for cells carrying a type of TP53 mutation seen in breast carcinomas when the mutation resides on Arg72 allele. These are not seen in colorectal neoplasms. A senescence rescue screen identifies BCL6 as an inhibitor of anti-proliferative p19(ARF)-p53 signaling. A shift from one p53 intron 2 genotype in the blood to another genotype in the tissue may be a prognostic factor in ovarian cancer patients. A significant association between p53 gene Bam HI RFLP polymorphism and the infarction volume was found in patients with carotid atherothrombotic stroke from Moscow population. A significant correlation between YB-1 and PCNA-LI was found, but none was found between p53 expression and PCNA in lung cancer. A significant increase in p21, p53, and fas mRNA expression were reported in the proximal incompetent veins. The expression of p21 correlated with expression of p53. Fas overexpression did not correlate with p53 expression.

Abnormality of the p53 pathway was detected in cervix cancer and in CINs. Acetylation of p53 in vivo may contribute, at least in part, to its transcriptional activation functions. Activated caspase-8 initiates the release of cytochrome c during thymoquine-induced apoptosis, thus offering a potential mechanism for TQ-induced apoptosis in p53-null HL-60 cancer cells. Activated p53 suppresses EZH2 expression, suggesting a further role for p53 in epigenetic regulation and in the maintenance of genetic stability. Activation domain 2 of p53 is required for induction of the proapoptotic target gene insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP3) and p53 basic domain inhibits induction of this gene. Activation of p53 reduces binding and relieves transcriptional repression of the Dnmt1gene, whereas loss of p53, a frequent, early event in tumorigenesis, may significantly contribute to aberrant genomic methylation. Activities of p53 are regulated during the cell cycle by E2F/p53 interactions; phosphorylation of p53 at Ser315 is required for this regulation. Adenovirus encoding HIV-1 Vpr activates caspase 9 and induces apoptotic cell death in both p53 positive and negative human tumor cell lines. Adenovirus infection does not need direct binding of E1B-55-kDa with p53 to inactivate p53, and forced p53 activity with consecutive apoptosis does not severely impair virus replication.

CARF is co-regulated with ARF and cooperates with it in activating p53. CD27 and CD40 co-stimulatory signals regulated the p53-amplified apoptotic pathway in B cells through the inhibition of p53-independent apoptotic pathway primarily induced by BCR ligation. CHIP-induced degradation was observed for mutant and wild-type p53, which transiently associate with molecular chaperones Hsc70 and Hsp90 and can be diverted onto a degradation pathway through this association. COX-2-positive prostate cancer cells can have impaired p53 function even in the presence of wild-type p53 and that p53 activity can be restored in these cells via inhibition of COX-2 activity. CP-31398-mediated stabilization of p53 may result from reduced ubiquitination, leading to high levels of transcriptionally active p53.

This gene is mutated in breast cancer. This protein and p73 interact with CTF2 and regulate HMG1 gene expression. This protein interacts with TFAM and helps regulate DNA damage. This protein is required for the Nuclear localization of Y-box factor YB1. This study focused on the expression levels of Bcl-2 family regulators (anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, pro-apoptotic Bcl-Xs and Bax), p53, and PCNA as a marker of proliferation, together with the evaluation of the level of apoptosis in human embryos.

Through a combination of induced p53 aggregation and diminished site-specific DNA binding activity, Zn2+ loss may represent a significant inactivation pathway for p53 in the cell. Thus, the accumulation of mutant p53 in tumor cells may contribute to tumorigenesis by inhibiting stress-inducible kinase pathways. Tip60 plays a double role in the p53 pathway: under normal growth conditions, Tip60 contributes to maintain a basal pool of p53 by interfering with its degradation; following DNA damage, Tip60 functions as p53 co-activator. Tissue samples from 42 ulcerative colitis patients were evaluated for p53 alterations by immunohistochemistry, loss of heterozygosity analysis, polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism and direct sequencing. To determine whether genotoxic stress regulates DNA binding by p53 in vivo, we have performed quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays on tumor and normal cell lines containing wild-type p53. Transactivation-deficient Delta TA-p73 inhibits p53 by direct competition for DNA binding: implications for tumorigenesis. Transactivation-dependent apoptosis does not always play a major role in p53-dependent apoptosis, indirectly supporting the importance role of the transactivation-independent mechanism. Transcriptional activity depends on p53 and BRCA1: inability of the mutant suppressor to repress IGF-IR expression result in increased IGF-IR levels and IGF binding. Transcriptionally active p53 is required for nuclear localization of Y-box-binding protein (YB1). TrkA induces apoptosis of neuroblastoma cells and does so via a p53-dependent mechanism. Tumor cell killing by autologous cytotoxic T lymphocytes can be enhanced by targeting degranulation-independent mechanisms via restoration of wild-type p53, a key determinant of apoptotic machinery regulation. Tumor cells with wild-type p53 activity exhibited up-regulation of surface CD95 after ionizing irradiation. Tumor protein p53, a nuclear protein, plays an essential role in the regulation of cell cycle, specifically in the transition from G0 to G1.  It is found in very low levels in normal cells, however, in a variety of transformed cell lines, it is expressed in high amounts, and believed to contribute to transformation and malignancy.  p53 is a DNA-binding protein containing DNA-binding, oligomerization and transcription activation domains.  It is postulated to bind as a tetramer to a p53-binding site and activate expression of downstream genes that inhibit growth and/or invasion, and thus function as a tumor suppressor.  Mutants of p53 that frequently occur in a number of different human cancers fail to bind the consensus DNA binding site, and hence cause the loss of tumor suppressor activity.  Alterations of the TP53 gene occur not only as somatic mutations in human malignancies, but also as germline mutations in some cancer-prone families with Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Tumor-derived p53 mutants increase the cell growth rate. They cannot bind the wild-type p53 consensus sequence. The mutants have &apos;gain of function&apos; properties.

UbcH5B/C are E2s for Mdm2, which contribute to the maintenance of low levels of p53 and Mdm2 in unstressed cells; inhibition of p53 ubiquitination and degradation by targeting UbcH5B/C is not sufficient to up-regulate p53 transcriptional activity. Ubiquitination and degradation of p53 are largely controlled by Mdm2, an oncogenic E3 ligase. Under severe hypoxic conditions p53 protein accumulates only in S phase; this correlates with replication arrest. Inhibition of ATR kinase activity substantially reduces hypoxia-induced phosphorylation of p53 protein on ser 15 as well as p53 accumulation.

We probe the significance of mitochondrial p53 and show that tumor-derived transactivation-deficient mutants of p53 concomitantly lose the ability to interact with BclXL and promote cytochrome c release. We propose that induction of NQO2 may relate to the observed increased expression of p53 that, in turn, contributes to the observed suppression of cell growth in both melanoma cell lines.
