<tr><td WIDTH=20%>Inbred Strain</td><td WIDTH=40%>Mated b x s for 20+ consecutive generationsParent and offspring mating </td><td WIDTH=40%>Symbol designated by capital letter or letters (four letters or fewer) in Roman type eg. BN, SHR</td></tr>
<tr><td>Related Inbred Strain</td><td>Strain with common origin but separated before F20</td><td>Symbol should indicate the relationshipSymbols should be together in the alphabetical list (e.g. SS SR)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Substrain</td><td>Separated after 20 but before 40 generations of b x s mating Genetic differences (residual heterozygosity or mutation) from other branches are discoveredBranch is separated for 20+ generation</td><td>Name of the parent strain slash ILAR code (if a lab has more than one substrain serial number is added before the ILAR code) eg. BN/NHsdMcwi</td></tr>
<tr><td>Recombinant Inbred Strain</td><td>Formed by crossing 2 inbred strains followed by 20+ generations of b x s mating </td><td>Abbreviation of both parental strain names separated with capital X with no spaceDifferent RI strains in a series is distinguished by numbers following the symbol BXH1, BXH2</td></tr>
<tr><td>Coisogenic Strain</td><td>Inbred strains that differ at only a single locus through mutation occurring in that strain</td><td>Strain symbol or substrain symbol followed by a hyphen and the gene symbol of the differential allele in italics eg XX-&ltI&gtAbc&lt/I&gt which will be displayed as XX-<i>Abc</i></td></tr>
<tr><td>Congenic Strain</td><td>Produced by repeated backcrosses to inbred (background) strain with selection for a particular marker from the donor strain.Minimum 10 backcross generation to the background strain should be made</td><td>Abbreviated symbol of the recipient strain separated by period from abbreviated symbol of the donor strain hyphen the differential allele(s) If a chromosomal segment has been transferred list the most proximal and the most distal markers in parenthesis separated by a hyphen slash ILAR code of the lab eg. SHR.BN-(&lti&gtD13Arb5-Ren&lt/i&gt)/Ipcv will be displayed as SHR.BN-(<i>D13Arb5-Ren</i>)/Ipcv.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Consomic Strain/Chromosome substitution strain</td><td>Produced by repeated backcrossing of the whole chromosome onto an inbred strainMinimum of 10 backcross generations is required</td><td>AAbbreviated host strain hyphen chromosome number strain of origin is all capitalized superscript eg SHR.Y&ltsup&gtBN&lt/sup&gt will be displayed asSHR.Y<sup>BN</sup> </td></tr>
<tr><td>Segregating Inbred Strains</td><td>Inbred strains in which a particular allele or mutation is maintained in heterozygous state</td><td>Named as inbred strains and the segregated locus is a part of the standard genotype</td></tr>
<tr><td>Conplastic Strain </td><td>Nuclear genome from one strain has been crossed onto the cytoplasm of another, mitochondrial donor is always the female parent</td><td>Abbreviated strain with the nuclear genome hyphen mt (mitochondrial) superscript strain of the cytoplasmic genome</td></tr>
