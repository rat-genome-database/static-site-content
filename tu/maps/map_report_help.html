  Search form</strong></p>
<p>A marker search box is provided on each map report. <strong>A marker name</strong> 
  can be entered along with a <strong>bin interval</strong> and the script will 
  find the marker's location on the current map and chromosome. The <strong>bin 
  interval</strong> determines how much of the surrounding markers are also displayed.</p>

<p>The graphical image (see example below) shows part of the FHH x ACI genetic 
  map. The mapped markers are shown in black and red on the left side of the map, 
  red markers are framework markers, black are placement markers. </p>

<p>The chromosome is divided into bins indicated by the dark and light orange 
  bars with the cM scale running along side. Clicking the bars will bring up a 
  Bin report listing the complete set of markers mapped in that region. Shown 
  below is the example for the first bin on chromosome 19.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The marker names are hyperlinked to the marker reports.</li>
  <li>If a marker has been reported as being linked to a particular gene this 
    is listed in the Related Gene column.</li>
  <li>F/P indicates if a marker is a framework or placement marker</li>
  <li>LOD is the score that the marker was placed at on the map. Framework markers 
    have a LOD of 0 on genetic maps.</li>
</ul>
