<p>The ACP Haplotyper report is a multipage PDF document consisting of 4 major 
  sections. To preserve the results in a readable format an <a href="acp_hap_help.pdf">annotated 
  sample output</a> is available which briefly describes the contents of the major 
  sections and has detailed information on the visual haplotype section. The sample 
  is taken from a report of chromosome 20 generated using SHRSP as the Primary 
  Strain (colored blue), BN/SsnHsd as the secondary strain (colored red) based 
  upon the radiation hybrid map v2.1.</p>
<p>View the <a href="acp_hap_help.pdf"> annotated sample PDF output</a> (Primary/Secondary 
  Color scheme)</p>
<p>View the same haplotyper result colored using: <a href="multicolor_acp.pdf">Multicolored 
  Scheme</a>, <a href="red_white_blue_acp.pdf">Red/White/Blue color scheme</a>.</p>
