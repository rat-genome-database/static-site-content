<p>The measurable phenotype category that was studied

              article, only the trait with the highest statistical significance 
              will be indicated.</p>

<p><a name="sub_trait" id="sub_trait"></a><strong>Sub-trait</strong></p>
<p>If applicable, a subcategory of the trait measured. 
              For example, a QTL defined by measuring systolic blood pressure 
              would have a Trait entry of <em>Blood pressure</em> and a subtrait 
              of <em>systolic</em>. This allows a degree of categorization of 
              QTLs and their traits. A more comprehensive controlled vocabulary 
              is in development.</p>

<p>QTLs typically have up to three pieces of mapping 
              information associated with them:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Two <strong>Flanking Markers</strong> defining the limits of the QTL</li>
  <li>One <strong>Peak Marker</strong>, defining the 
                position of the highest point on the probability curve (LOD plot) 
                or smallest P-value</li>
</ul>
<p>These are shown graphically in the example QTL diagram below:</p>
<p><img src="../images/QTL_diagram.jpg" width="454" height="240" border="1"></p>
<p>Mapping information is shown for any or all of 
              the flanking or peak markers that have been reported in the literature. 
              If these markers are not present on a genetic or radiation hybrid 
              map within RGD this is shown by the text "No mapping information 
              available within RGD" even though these markers have obviously been 
              mapped in the QTL study. If mapping data is available, it is linked 
              to further information as shown below:</p>
