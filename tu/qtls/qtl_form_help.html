            <P>Enter a QTL symbol, alias or keyword. This tool will search the 
              QTL symbol, name and alias (synonym) fields in the database. The 
              asterisk '<STRONG>*</STRONG>' is an accepted wildcard. In addition, 
              various other options are available to refine the search (See below).</P>

<P><a id="annotations" name="annotations"></a><strong>Annotations</strong></P>
 <p>Search for QTLs based on your keyword matching 
              curated annotations. These include free text and controlled vocabulary 
              (Disease and Phenotype ontologies). When searching ontologies the 
              terms' synonyms and descendant terms will also be searched.</p>
			  
<p><a name="trait" id="trait"></a><strong>Trait</strong> </p>
<P>Restrict the returned QTLs to those detected for a particular phenotypic 
              trait. The traits currently listed are those reported by the researcher 
              in the publication. A controlled vocabulary to describe these more 
              uniformly is under development.</P>

<P><a id="strains" name="strains"></a><strong>Strains</strong></P>
<p>Restrict the returned QTLs to those detected using a particular strain. </p>
			  
<p><strong><a name="chromosome" id="chromosome"></a>Chromosome</strong> </p>
<P>Restrict the returned QTLs to ones mapped to a particular chromosome. 
              The limit may also include the start and stop coordinates on the 
              genome assembly version listed next to the input boxes.</P>
