<p>Summary of known information about this gene including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Product - brief information on the gene product (protein size, etc)</li>
  <li>Function - brief summary of the gene's function in the cell</li>
  <li>Description - Other pertinent information about the gene gleaned from the 
    literature curated by RGD.</li>
  <li>Gene Ontology - Listing of GO terms annotated to this gene, see <a href="/GO/">GO 
    Help</a> for more information</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="mapping_data" id="mapping_data"></a><strong>Mapping Data</strong></p>
<p>Mapping information contained in RGD is shown for the gene itself if it has 
  been mapped directly onto one of the standard maps or has been located on the 
  cytogenic map by FISH or similar techniques. Also listed are any associated 
  SSLP map locations which are microsatellite markers that are closely linked 
  to the gene and hence have been used as markers for the gene location on other 
  maps. The mapping information is linked to further information as shown below:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Symbol - links to the main report for that object (either a gene or an SSLP 
    report)</li>
  <li>Map Name - links to the Map report for that map</li>
  <li>Chr. (Chromosome) - links to the map for that particular chromosome</li>
  <li>Position - links to the map for that chromosome with the location of the 
    particular marker highlighted in the text listing of the markers.</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="external_database" id="external_database"></a><strong>External 
  Database Links</strong></p>
<p>Links to other databases which have information about this gene. The links 
  are grouped by parent database and each link has a user-friendly text (e.g. 
  PubMed citation, LocusLink gene symbol, etc.) followed in parentheses by the 
  actual accession number used in the parent database (PubMed ID, LocusLink number<strong>).</strong></p>
<p><a name="curated_references" id="curated_references"></a><strong>Curated References</strong></p>
<p>References curated by the RGD curation team that contain information pertaining 
  to this gene.</p>
