<p>The Rat Radiation Hybrid Panel is a 106 hybrid panel. More information is available 
  from Research Genetics. The Rat RH framework was generated using hybrids 1 through 
  100. </p>
<p>The RH vectors should consist of 0's, 1', or 2's from hybrids # 1-106 in that 
  order. In the RH vectors, 0 represents negative, 1 positive and 2 ambiguous 
  or missing data. If you have missed hybrids, please add 2's for those missing 
  hybrids. If you have vectors with length shorter than 106, the tool will add 
  2's at the end of your vector. </p>
<p>Data Format - The data should be arranged in the following format:</p>

</p>
<p>The data consists of 2 columns delimited by a tab, space or comma: the first 
  is the marker name which is limited to 11 characters; the second is the RH vector 
  string. Any columns beyond the first two will be discarded. </p>
