<p>Based on the selected Genetic or RH map, markers that are polymorphic between 
  the two selected strains are organized into bins based on the desired scan resolution. 
  For example, to pick polymorphic markers for a 10cM genome scan you would select 
  a 10cM bin size and you could then pick one marker from each 10cM bin and thereby 
  get coverage of the desired chromosome(s) at the desired resolution.</p>
<p>Sample results are shown below for a cross between FHH and ACI using the Radiation 
  Hybrid map and a bin size of 50cR for an analysis of chromosome 20.</p>
<p>1. Chromosome report</p>
<p align="left"><img src="/tu/images/gen_scanner_table.gif" width="432" height="89"></p>
<p>This table shows the length (in cR for this example) , the number of 50cR bins 
  along the chromosome, the proportion of polymorphic markers and the polymorphism 
  percentage (23/39 * 100%)</p>
<p>Below the report is the Polymorphism table itself:</p>
<p><img src="/tu/images/gen_scanner_results.gif" width="558" height="216"></p>
<p>This shows the first two bins on Chromosome 20. The first three columns are 
  related to the map (the marker, its position, the LOD score of its placement), 
  followed by the marker allele size in the two strains and the difference between 
  the two sizes. If the difference is in the range selected on the original form 
  (4-20bp in this example) it is highlighted in green. The checkbox allows the 
  selection of one or more markers from each bin to assemble into a run list for 
  a genome scan.</p>
<p>At the end of the polymorphism table, a second form allowing the user to assemble 
  all the selected markers (add to runlist option checked) into a single runlist 
  for use in the lab.</p>
<p><img src="/tu/images/gen_scanner_form2.gif" alt="runlist options" width="477" height="159" border="1"></p>
<p>Clicking 'Generate Runlist' will return a new page (or text file depending 
  on the output format) listing just the selected markers:</p>
<p><img src="/tu/images/gen_scanner_rlist.gif" alt="genome scanner runlist" width="609" height="410" border="1"></p>
<p>This can then be printed out or saved and provides a list of the polymorphic 
  markers to be used in a genome scan experiment, along with the expected sizes 
  in each strain.</p>
