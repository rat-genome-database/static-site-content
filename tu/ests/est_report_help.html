<p><a name="symbol" id="symbol"></a><strong>Symbol</strong></p>

<p>The official EST symbol (usually GenBank Accession number)</p>

<p><a name="definition" id="definition"></a><strong>EST Definition</strong></p>

<p>GenBank EST definition line</p>

<p><a name="previous_symbol" id="previous_symbol"></a><strong>Previous Symbol/alias</strong></p>

<p>Symbols that have been used to refer to this EST in the past, often Iowa's 
  internal EST code.</p>

<p><a name="associated_genes" id="associated_genes"></a><strong>Associated Genes</strong></p>

<p>Gene(s) known to be identified by the EST sequence.</p>
<p><a name="associated_seqs" id="associated_seqs"></a><strong>Associated Sequences</strong></p>
<p>The Primer and/or clone sequence for this EST shown 5' to 3'. Primer locations 
  on the clone sequence are indicated by blue underlined sequence.</p>

<p><a name="mapping_data" id="mapping_data"></a><strong>Mapping Data</strong></p>

<p>Mapping information contained in RGD is shown for the EST itself if it has 
  been mapped directly onto one of the standard maps or has been located on the 
  cytogenic map by FISH or similar techniques. The mapping information is linked 
  to further information as shown below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Symbol - links to the main report for that object (either a gene or an SSLP 
    report)</li>
  <li>Map Name - links to the Map report for that map</li>
  <li>Chr. (Chromosome) - links to the map for that particular chromosome</li>
  <li>Position - links to the map for that chromosome with the location of the 
    particular marker highlighted in the text listing of the markers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Where available, links to <a href="/tu/vcmap/">VCMap</a> are also provided 
  to allow access to the VCMap bin reports showing mapped and predicted locations 
  for markers and the syntenic regions in Mouse and Human.</p>
<p><a name="external_database" id="external_database"></a><strong>External 

  Database Links</strong></p>

<p>Links to other databases, which have information about this EST. The links 
  are grouped by parent database and each link has a user-friendly text (e.g. 
  PubMed citation, LocusLink gene symbol, etc.) followed in parentheses by the 
  actual accession number used in the parent database (PubMed ID, LocusLink number<strong>).</strong></p>

<p><a name="curated_references" id="curated_references"></a><strong>Curated References</strong></p>

<p>References curated by the RGD curation team that contain information pertaining 
  to this EST.</p>
