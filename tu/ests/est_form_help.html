<a name="gene_symbol" id="gene_symbol"></a><strong>EST Symbol/Alias/Keyword</strong> 
<p>Enter a gene symbol, alias or keyword to search for. The asterisk '<strong>*</strong>' 
  is an accepted wildcard, in addition various other options are available to 
  refine the search:</p>
<p><a name="chromosome" id="chromosome"></a><strong>Chromosome</strong> </p>
<p>Restrict the returned genes to ones mapped to a particular chromosome. Excludes 
  genes that are unmapped or mapped to a different chromosome</p>
<p><a name="limit_sslps" id="limit_sslps"></a><strong>Limit to genes with associated 
  SSLPs </strong> </p>
<p>Restrict the returned genes to ones that have SSLPs (microsatellite markers) 
  associated with them. Associated SSLPs are believed to be in linkage disequilibrium 
  with the gene itself and hence are markers for the gene on genetic and RH maps.</p>
<p><a name="limit_homologs" id="limit_homologs"></a><strong>Limit to genes with 
  known Homologs</strong> </p>
<p>Restrict the returned genes to ones which have a known homolog listed in RGD 
  (from any organism) .</p>
<p><a name="results_ordered_by" id="results_ordered_by"></a><strong>Results ordered 
  by</strong> </p>
<ul>
  <li>Symbol - sorts returned results alphabetically by gene symbol</li>
  <li>Name - sorts returned results alphabetically by gene name</li>
  <li>Chromosome - sorts returned results by chromosome and then alphabetically 
    by gene symbol</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="results_per_page" id="results_per_page"></a><strong>Results per page</strong> 
</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Defines the number of hits that are returned on each results page, the more 
    results displayed, the longer the page and the longer it will take to download.</p>
